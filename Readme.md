# Perky Engine

Perky Engine is a JavaScript game engine currently in development, designed to simplify the game creation process. Integrating the rendering capabilities of PixiJS with the dynamic audio features of Tone.js.


## Open Source Philosophy

This engine is open source and will be documented as best as possible. It is primarily a personal project for my own game development needs, shared for those curious. While I'm open to making it a community project, I won't be leading that initiative.

Feel free to adjust it further to better fit your style!


## Key Features

- **Customizable Toolset**: Perky Engine is designed for developers to create and display their own graphical tools on-demand.
- **PixiJS Rendering**: Leverage the versatile rendering options of [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) for your game's graphics.
- **Tone.js Audio**: Easily manage game audio with the comprehensive capabilities of [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
- **Developer-Centric Design**: Inspired by the developer-friendly principles of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/), and structured around a node system reminiscent of [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
